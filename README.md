## an advanced programming language!


C++ is a powerful mid-level and multi-paradigm programming language that was designed by Bjarne Stroustrup in `1983`.
This language combines the speed and control of C with modern features like object oriented programming, templates, and data abstraction. For this reason, C++ is an excellent choice for building game engines, banking software, robotics systems, and embedded platforms.
In fact, C++ is an advanced version of the C language; with the difference that it supports the concept of object oriented programmin something that does not exist in C. This feature allows programmers to build more complex structures and produce more maintainable code.
The name "C++" was suggested by a person named **Rick Mascitti** in `1983`. 



The symbol in C means "increment," and this naming shows that C++ is a more advanced and powerful version of C.
In `1998`, the first official version of it was released by ISO under the name C++98, and it transformed the global programming community.

**What was Stroustrup's purpose in creating the C++ programming language⁉️**
