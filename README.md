## C++ is a powerful mid-level programming language!

In the early 1980s, specifically in 1983, Bjarne Stroustrup created the C++ language. It’s a high-performance and versatile language used for building game engines, banking software, robotics, embedded systems, and more.
In essence, C++ is an advanced version of the C language. While C focuses on procedural programming, C++ introduces object-oriented programming, which allows developers to model complex systems using classes and objects—something C lacks.
The name “C++” was suggested to Stroustrup by Rick Mascitti, and it cleverly reflects the idea of enhancement: in C,  means increment, so “C++” literally implies “an improved version of C.”
